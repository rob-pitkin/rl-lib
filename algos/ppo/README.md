# PPO

```ppo``` is an implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization from scratch with Python and PyTorch. The goal of this project is to create a simple implementation of PPO that runs on CPU and operates within discrete/enumerable action spaces (low dimension).

## Usage
To train the agent, run the following command:
```
python main.py
```

Use the main.py file as a template for how to train and evaluate the agent. You can modify the hyperparameters, the environment, and the neural network architecture to suit your needs.
